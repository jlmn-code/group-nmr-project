# group-nmr-project

Welcome everyone. I want to create a code to manipulate a nmr collection

The idea is:

1.  open a large collection of nmr of HSQC

I don't have NMR spectra but I have worked so much with them and know its structure and form and I can simulated. In the file `code` there is a script `nmr_simulator.py` where in *python* code create 15 *HSQC* with the same structure that a real HSQC save in **MNova** software in format `.txt` or .csv

2. to do a list

3. reduce the size the files

::: {layout-ncol=2}
![Column graph reduction size of HSQC files](images/fig-save.jpeg){#fig-reduction}

![All HSQC spectra](images/fig-all-dataset.jpeg){#fig-dataset}
:::
